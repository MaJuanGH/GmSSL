# Standards

## Chinese Commercial Cryptography Standards

The GmSSL provides the (partial) implementations of the following Chinese national standards released by the Office of State Commercial Cryptography Administration (OSCCA) of China. Each standard is assigned with a standard number `GM/T AAAA.B-YYYY` and the name, where the 4-digit `AAAA` is the major number, and the digit `B` is the minor number. The 4-digit `YYYY` is the year this standard released. These standards are public sold over the Internet in both Chinese version and English version (http://www.chinesestandard.net).

The standards are sorted in the following of the standard numbers:
