# POD (Plain Old Documentation) File Format

The POD format is used for perl source code documentation. In OpenSSL, the manages were written in POD format and converted to man page format and HTML pages.

Some of the man pages should be updated with new options introduced by the GmSSL project. Here we will list all these pod files to be changed:

* `doc/apps/ciphers.pod`
* `doc/apps/config.pod`
* `doc/apps/dgst.pod`
* `doc/apps/ec.pod`
* `doc/apps/ecparam.pod`
* `doc/apps/enc.pod`
* `doc/apps/engine.pod`
* `doc/apps/list.pod`
* `doc/apps/pkey.pod`
* `doc/apps/s_client.pod`
* `doc/apps/s_server.pod`
